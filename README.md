# 📚 PeerNotes

> _A living knowledge base for tech exploration and discovery_

Welcome to **PeerNotes** – my personal documentation site built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build). This is where I document my tech journey, capture solutions to problems I've solved, and share knowledge that might help others facing similar challenges.

## 🎯 What is PeerNotes?

PeerNotes is my personal, evolving knowledge base – a place where I document everything from quick fixes and cheat sheets to comprehensive tutorials based on real-world experiences. It serves two purposes:

1. **Personal Reference**: A searchable repository of solutions, commands, and procedures I've used, so I don't have to rediscover them later
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Open documentation that others can benefit from, learn from, or contribute to

Every guide and note here represents actual work I've done, problems I've solved, or tools I've explored. It's not just theoretical – it's practical knowledge from hands-on experience.

## 🗂️ Current Documentation

This knowledge base is continuously growing as I encounter new challenges and explore different technologies. Here's what's currently available:

### 📋 **Cheat Sheets**

Quick-reference guides for tools I use regularly:

- **Git workflows and commands** – Essential Git operations for daily development
- _More references added as I encounter useful patterns and shortcuts_

### 📖 **Guides & Tutorials**

Detailed walkthroughs based on actual implementations:

- **Creating bootable VHDX files** – Step-by-step process for Windows environments
- **Setting up Kubernetes on WSL** – Complete guide for local development
- **Configuring Proxmox clusters** – Enterprise virtualization setup
- **Creating Proxmox Ubuntu VM templates** – Streamlined VM provisioning
- **SSH setup with ssh-import-id** – Simplified SSH key management
- **DevTunnels configuration** – Secure tunneling for development
- **PowerToys Run shortcuts** – Productivity enhancements for Windows

### 🛠️ **Tools & Resources**

As this section grows, it will include curated tools, scripts, and utilities I've found valuable in development and system administration.

## 📈 Evolution & Growth

This site reflects my ongoing technical journey. New content is added when I:
- Solve interesting technical challenges
- Discover useful tools or techniques
- Complete projects worth documenting
- Find better ways to accomplish common tasks

Each piece of documentation has been tested and used in real scenarios – nothing here is purely theoretical.

## 🌐 Live Documentation

The full documentation site is available at: **[https://thomaspeire.github.io/peernotes](https://thomaspeire.github.io/peernotes/)**

## 💡 Documentation Philosophy

Every piece of content here follows a few core principles:

- **Experience-Driven**: Only documenting what I've actually implemented or used
- **Context-Rich**: Including the why, not just the how
- **Future-Self Friendly**: Written so I can understand and replicate months later
- **Community Helpful**: Structured so others can follow along and adapt to their needs
- **Continuously Improved**: Updated when I learn better approaches or find issues

The goal is documentation that's genuinely useful – both for quick reference when I need to repeat something, and for comprehensive guidance when others want to implement similar solutions.

### 🤖 AI Enhancement Disclaimer

While the technical content, procedures, and solutions documented here are based entirely on my personal hands-on experience, some documentation has been enhanced using AI assistance for improved layout, structure, and semantic clarity. The core knowledge, steps, and technical details remain authentic to my actual implementations and discoveries – AI has only helped make the presentation clearer and more readable.
