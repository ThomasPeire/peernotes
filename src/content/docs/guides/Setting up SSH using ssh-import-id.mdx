In this guide, we'll be walking you through the process of setting up SSH access using `ssh-import-id`.
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Access to the machine where you will generate the SSH key.
- A GitHub account.
- Access to the target Linux machine.

## Generating a New SSH Key Pair

On the connecting machine, generate a new SSH key pair using the following command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

The generated key can be found in the default location:

- **Windows**: `%UserProfile%/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
- **Linux/Mac**: `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`

## Adding the Public Key to GitHub

<Steps>
    1. Copy the public key to the clipboard.
    2. Go to your GitHub settings page and navigate to the **SSH and GPG keys** section.
    3. Click **New SSH Key** and paste the copied key in the **Key** field.
</Steps>

## Importing the Key on the Target Linux Machine

<Steps>
    1. If you don't have the `ssh-import-id` package installed, install it using the following command:

        ```bash
        apt install ssh-import-id
        ```

    2. Import the public key from GitHub using the following command, replacing `<username>` with your GitHub username:

        ```bash
        ssh-import-id gh:<username>
            ```
</Steps>
