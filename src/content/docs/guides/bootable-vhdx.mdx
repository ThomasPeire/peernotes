This guide walks you through creating a Virtual Hard Disk (VHDX) with a Windows installation that can be booted directly. This is useful for setting up test environments, backups, or portable Windows installations.

## Prerequisites

1. A Windows installation file in `.wim` format (such as `install.wim` from Windows installation media).
2. Administrator privileges on your machine.

## Steps to Create a Bootable VHDX

### 1. Create the VHDX Using Diskpart

Open Diskpart and follow these commands to create a fixed-size VHDX, attach it, and prepare it with a primary partition.

```powershell
# Open Diskpart
diskpart 

# Create a VHDX with a size of 25 GB
create vdisk file=C:\windows.vhdx maximum=25600 type=fixed 

# Attach the VHDX 
attach vdisk 

# Create a partition for the Windows files, format it, and assign it a drive letter 
create partition primary 
format quick label=vhdx 
assign letter=v 

# Exit Diskpart
exit
```

### 2. Apply the Windows Image to the VHDX

Use the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool to apply the Windows image to your newly created VHDX.

```powershell
# Get the index of the Windows installation that you want to deploy
dism /Get-WimInfo /WimFile:install.wim 

# Apply the WIM file with the correct index (replace `index` as needed)
dism /Apply-Image /ImageFile:install.wim /index:1 /ApplyDir:V:\
```

### 3. Add a Boot Entry

To boot from the VHDX, add a new boot entry using the `bcdboot` command.

```powershell
# Add boot entry for the new VHD
bcdboot V:\Windows /d
```

### 4. Verify the Boot Configuration

Finally, confirm that the boot entry was successfully added and is properly configured by using the `bcdedit` command.

```powershell
# List all boot entries to verify the new entry
bcdedit /enum all
```

---

## Additional Information

- **BIOS/UEFI Configuration**: Ensure your system's BIOS or UEFI settings support booting from virtual hard disks if necessary.
- **Troubleshooting**: If the boot entry does not work as expected, try reviewing the output from the `bcdedit` command to confirm the entry is correct.
