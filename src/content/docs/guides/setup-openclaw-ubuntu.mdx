This guide outlines the process of deploying OpenClaw on a dedicated Ubuntu Virtual Machine. It covers everything from OS preparation to the final Telegram pairing.

## Prerequisites

*   **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS
*   **Resources:** 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM (Recommended)
*   **Network:** Static IP address recommended

## Installation Steps

<Steps>

1.  **Prepare the System**

    Start by ensuring the system is fully updated.

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

    (Optional) Configure SSH access using `ssh-import-id` for GitHub keys:
    ```bash
    ssh-import-id gh:ThomasPeire
    ```

2.  **Install Node.js 22.x**

    OpenClaw runs on Node.js. Install version 22 using the official NodeSource setup script.

    ```bash
    # Download and execute setup script
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash -
    
    # Install Node.js
    sudo apt install nodejs -y
    
    # Verify installation
    node --version
    # Expected output: v22.x.x
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies**

    Install Git and other necessary tools.

    ```bash
    sudo apt install git -y
    ```

4.  **Create Dedicated User**

    For security and isolation, run OpenClaw under a dedicated user account (`openclaw`) with passwordless `sudo` privileges.

    ```bash
    # Create user without password
    sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos "" openclaw

    # Grant sudo access
    sudo usermod -aG sudo openclaw

    # Configure passwordless sudo for automation
    echo "openclaw ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/openclaw
    ```

5.  **Switch to User**

    Log in as the new user to proceed with the installation.

    ```bash
    sudo su - openclaw
    
    # Export runtime directory (critical for systemd user services later)
    export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)
    ```

6.  **Install OpenClaw**

    Install the OpenClaw CLI globally via npm.

    ```bash
    sudo npm install -g openclaw@latest
    ```

7.  **Onboarding**

    Run the interactive setup wizard.

    ```bash
    openclaw onboard
    ```

    **Recommended Settings:**
    *   **Mode:** Manual onboarding
    *   **Gateway:** Local Gateway
    *   **Workspace:** Default (`~/.openclaw/workspace`)
    *   **Model:** Google Gemini (or preferred provider)
    *   **Channels:** Select `Telegram`
        *   Use `@BotFather` on Telegram to create a new bot (`/newbot`).
        *   Copy the API Token provided by BotFather.
    *   **Hooks/Skills:** Skip for now.

8.  **Configure Systemd Daemon**

    Set up OpenClaw to run in the background and start automatically on boot.

    ```bash
    # Enable lingering (allows user services to run without active session)
    sudo loginctl enable-linger openclaw

    # Install the systemd service
    openclaw daemon install

    # Reload and start the service
    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    systemctl --user enable --now openclaw-gateway
    
    # Check status
    systemctl --user status openclaw-gateway
    ```

    <Aside type="caution">
    If you see an error about "systemd user services unavailable", ensure you exported `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` in Step 5 and that `loginctl enable-linger` was run successfully.
    </Aside>

9.  **Security Audit**

    Run the built-in security auditor to detect and fix potential vulnerabilities.

    ```bash
    # Deep scan
    openclaw security audit --deep
    
    # Auto-fix issues
    openclaw security audit --fix
    ```

10. **Pairing**

    Connect your Telegram account to the running agent.

    1.  Open Telegram and start a chat with your bot.
    2.  The bot will reply with a **Pairing Code** (e.g., `123-456`).
    3.  Approve the pairing in the terminal:

    ```bash
    openclaw pairing approve telegram <YOUR_CODE>
    ```

</Steps>

## Verification

Your OpenClaw agent should now be online and responding to messages on Telegram. You can verify its status locally:

```bash
openclaw gateway status
```
