# High Availability Proxmox Cluster Setup

This guide walks you through setting up a high availability Proxmox cluster using three nodes with Ceph storage, providing resilient virtualization infrastructure for your lab or production environment.

## Hardware Requirements

<Aside type="note">
  This guide uses specific hardware, but the instructions can be adapted for similar components with adequate specifications.
</Aside>

For each of the 3 cluster nodes:
- **Mini PC**: GMKtec G3 Plus
- **Memory**: Corsair Vengeance SODIMM 32 GB (1 x 32 GB) DDR4 3200
- **System Drive**: Transcend MTS420 120GB M.2 SSD
- **Storage Drive**: LEXAR SSD M.2 2TB PCIe Gen 4X4 NM790 NVMe

## Initial Preparation

<Steps>
1. **Configure BIOS settings**
   - Ensure "SATA Operation" is set to "AHCI"
   - Enable virtualization features (VT-x/AMD-V)

2. **Create bootable Proxmox installation media**
   - Download the Proxmox VE ISO from [proxmox.com/downloads](https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads)
   - Create a bootable USB drive using Rufus or Etcher

3. **Install Proxmox on each node**
   - Boot from the USB drive
   - In the installation wizard:
     - Select the system disk (Transcend MTS420 120GB M.2 SSD)
     - Configure unique hostnames (e.g., pve1.peerlab.local, pve2.peerlab.local, pve3.peerlab.local)
     - Configure appropriate network settings
     - Set a strong password for the root user
   - Complete the installation and reboot each node
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  I experienced issues while booting with both HDMI and Ethernet plugged in, resulting in no HDMI output.
  The fix was to unplug the Ethernet cable during boot and reconnect it after the installation completed.
  After logging in, update the system and reboot:
    ```bash
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    reboot
    ```
</Aside>

## Post-Installation Configuration

<Steps>
1. **Access Proxmox Web Interface**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `https://<node-ip>:8006`
   - Log in with the root user and password set during installation

2. **Configure Repositories**
   - Disable the enterprise repository, as it requires a subscription
   - Go to `Updates` > `Repositories` and disable the enterprise repository
   - Add the no-subscription repository
3. **Update Proxmox**
    ```bash
    apt update && apt upgrade -y
    reboot
    ```
</Steps>
