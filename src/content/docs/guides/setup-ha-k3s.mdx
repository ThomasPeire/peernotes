This guide walks you through setting up a highly available K3s cluster using embedded etcd for true HA configuration. Perfect for production environments that need resilience and automatic failover.

I choose for embedded etcd, since setting up an external database cluster will take me to far down the rabbit hole. Embedded etcd is sufficient for my homelab setup.

THIS IS STILL WIP
