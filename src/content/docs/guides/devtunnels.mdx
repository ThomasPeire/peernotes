In this guide, we’ll walk you through the process of setting up and using dev tunnels to expose your local services to the internet.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the Dev Tunnel CLI tool is installed before proceeding.

<Steps>
1. **Install the Dev Tunnel CLI tool**
    ```powershell
    # using winget
    winget install Microsoft.devtunnel
    ```
    To upgrade, use the upgrade command
    ```powershell
    winget upgrade Microsoft.devtunnel
    ```
2. **Log in using your Microsoft or GitHub account**
    ```powershell
    devtunnel user login
    ```
</Steps>

## One-Time Use Tunnel

### Exposing a Local Service

To expose a local service to the internet for one-time use, execute the following command:

```powershell
# Example: exposing port 8080
devtunnel host -p 8080
```

Upon execution, you’ll receive feedback in the terminal with the public URL of your service:

```powershell
# Example output
Hosting port: 8080
Connect via browser: https://shm5qgjz.euw.devtunnels.ms:8080, https://shm5qgjz-8080.euw.devtunnels.ms
Inspect network activity: https://shm5qgjz-8080-inspect.euw.devtunnels.ms

Ready to accept connections for tunnel: happy-cat-p2dcg82
```

### Allow Anonymous Access

By default, tunnels require authentication. To permit anonymous access, use the `--anonymous` or `-a` flag:

```powershell
# Example: exposing port 8080 with anonymous access
devtunnel host -p 8080 -a
```

To add temporary anonymous access to an existing tunnel:

```powershell
# Example: granting anonymous access for 6 hours
devtunnel access create happy-cat-p2dcg82 -a --expiration 6h
```

To stop the tunnel, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Persistent Tunnel

### Creating a Persistent Tunnel

You can create a dev tunnel without hosting it immediately. The tunnel retains its public URL, even if the service is restarted. Set a custom expiration time with the `--expiration` or `-e` flag (minimum: 1 hour, default/maximum: 30 days).

```powershell
# Example: creating a persistent tunnel with a 20-day expiration
devtunnel create peertunnel --expiration 20d
```

### Assigning a Port to the Tunnel

Assign a port to the persistent tunnel using the `port create` command:

```powershell
# Example: assigning port 8080 to the tunnel
devtunnel port create peertunnel -p 8080
```

### Allow Anonymous Access

Grant temporary anonymous access to a specific port in the tunnel:

```powershell
# Example: granting anonymous access for 6 hours
devtunnel access create peertunnel -a --expiration 6h
```
