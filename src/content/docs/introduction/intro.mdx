**PeerNotes** is my personal, evolving knowledge base where I document my tech journey, capture solutions to problems I've solved, and share knowledge that might help others facing similar challenges.

This is more than just documentation – it's a living repository of real-world experiences, tested procedures, and practical insights from hands-on work. Every guide and note here represents actual implementations, problems solved, and tools explored.

<Aside type="note" title="AI Enhancement Disclaimer">
While the technical content, procedures, and solutions documented here are based entirely on my personal hands-on experience, some documentation has been enhanced using AI assistance for improved layout, structure, and semantic clarity. The core knowledge, steps, and technical details remain authentic to my actual implementations and discoveries – AI has only helped make the presentation clearer and more readable.
