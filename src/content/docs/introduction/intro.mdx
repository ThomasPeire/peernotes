**PeerNotes** is my personal, evolving knowledge base where I document my tech journey, capture solutions to problems I've solved, and share knowledge that might help others facing similar challenges.

This isn't just another documentation site – it's a **living repository** of real-world experiences, battle-tested procedures, and practical insights from hands-on work. Every guide and note here represents actual implementations, problems I've encountered and solved, and tools I've explored in production environments.

## Why PeerNotes Exists

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Personal Reference" icon="magnifier">
        A searchable repository of solutions I've used, so I don't have to rediscover them later. Because let's be honest – we all forget that one command we used six months ago!
    </Card>
    <Card title="Knowledge Sharing" icon="heart">
        Open documentation that others can benefit from, learn from, and contribute to. If it helped me solve a problem, it might help you too.
    </Card>
</CardGrid>

## What you'll find here

<CardGrid stagger>
    <Card title="Quick References" icon="document">
        **Cheat Sheets** for tools I use daily – Git workflows, command shortcuts, and configuration snippets that save time.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Step-by-Step Guides" icon="open-book">
        **Detailed Tutorials** walking through complex setups like Kubernetes clusters, Proxmox configurations, and development environments.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Troubleshooting" icon="warning">
        **Problem Solutions** for those tricky issues that took hours to figure out – documented so you (and future me) don't have to struggle again.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Tools & Scripts" icon="puzzle">
        **Curated Resources** – utilities, scripts, and tools that have proven their worth in real projects.
    </Card>
</CardGrid>

## What Makes This Different

- **📺 Experience-Driven**: Only documenting what I've actually implemented and tested
- **🎯 Context-Rich**: Not just *how* to do something, but *why* and *when* it matters
- **🔄 Living Documentation**: Continuously updated as I learn better approaches
- **🌱 Growing Organically**: New content added as I encounter interesting challenges

<Aside type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Use the search function to quickly find specific commands, configurations, or solutions. The site is designed to be as useful for quick lookups as it is for comprehensive learning.
</Aside>

## The Journey Continues

This knowledge base grows with every project, every problem solved, and every "aha!" moment. Whether you're here for a quick reference or diving deep into a complex setup, I hope you find something useful.

**Happy exploring!**

<Aside type="note" title="🤖 AI Enhancement Disclaimer">
While the technical content, procedures, and solutions documented here are based entirely on my personal hands-on experience, some documentation has been enhanced using AI assistance for improved layout, structure, and semantic clarity. The core knowledge, steps, and technical details remain authentic to my actual implementations and discoveries – AI has only helped make the presentation clearer and more readable.
